## **Google and Facebook Ads Integration: OAuth2 Redirect Flow**

### 1. **Initiate the Flow**
- Your app constructs an OAuth2 URL containing:
  - **Client ID** (from your Google Developer Console)
  - **Desired scopes** (e.g., `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords` for managing ads)
  - **Redirect URI** where the user will be sent after granting access.

### 2. **User Login & Consent**
- When the user clicks the link, they are taken to Google’s OAuth2 consent screen.
  - If they are not already signed in, Google will prompt them to do so.
  - The user reviews the permissions your app is requesting and clicks “Allow.”

### 3. **Receive Authorization Code**
- After the user grants permission, Google redirects them to your specified **redirect URI** with an **authorization code** appended as a query parameter.

### 4. **Exchange for Tokens**
- Your app exchanges the authorization code for:
  - **Access token** (to make API requests)
  - **Refresh token** (if specified, for long-term access)

## User Experience : 
In your app, you simply present a “Connect Your Account” button. When clicked, it redirects the user to the appropriate OAuth consent screen (Google’s or Facebook’s). The user logs in and approves the requested permissions, and then your app captures the authorization code (usually via a callback URL) to obtain tokens.
